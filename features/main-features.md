## **Advanced verification system**

* Grants a role to the member upon successful verification

Supports three types of verification:

* **Simple**: Members will have to press a button to get verified This type is effective against automated user accounts.
* **Password**: Set a pre-defined password which the user has to enter (using buttons) to get verified. Useful if you own a super exclusive server or you just want to hide the password in your rules, ensuring that all new members will actually read your server's rules :)
* **Randomised**: Make the bot randomise the password (of specified length) which the user has to enter (using buttons) to get verified.
