{% hint style="warning" %}
The bot will start tracing invites automatically without any setup!
This step is completely optional, and is required only if you want the bot to log the invites in a channel. 
{% endhint %}

# Basic setup

**Setting up join/leave channels**: Use the `/config set` slash command to setup join and leave channels by specifying the channel.

# Customizing templates

{% hint style="warning" %}
The bot has a default template which will be used as soon as you set the join or leave channel.
If you wish to customise this, you can do so by by following the below guide.
{% endhint %}

**Setting up join/leave messages**: Use the [#set-as-template](commands/config.md#set-as-template "mention") context menu command to easily setup join/leave messages
