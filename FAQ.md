# FAQ

* It is not possible to assign role rewards (adding a role for x invites). This is because, doing so is against discord's terms of service.
* If you see "unknown user" or random numbers instead of usernames in the leaderboard / invited commands, your app does not have those users cached. You can copy the contents of the embed and paste it in a private channel (to avoid pinging the users) to force your app to cache them. If you look back at the embed after doing this, it should show their usernames.

## Basic setup

Learn how to setup the join channel, and how to customize the template  

### Settings up join/leave channels:  
* Use the `/config set` slash command to setup join and leave channels by providing the channel

### Setting up join/leave messages:  

{% hint style="info" %}
The bot has a default template which will be used as soon as you set the join or leave channel. Follow the below steps if you wish to customize the default templates
{% endhint %}  

* Look at [#variables](commands/config.md#variables "mention") for a list of available variables that you can use in your template.
* You can use the `/embed build` command for designing the template, or download premade json templates from this [repo](https://github.com/Siris01/invite-management-templates) and use the `/embed send <channel> <json>` command to send the template to the channel. 
* Once you are done designing the template, send it in any channel and then use the [#set-as-template](commands/config.md#set-as-template "mention") command on the message that you just sent (Right click -> Apps -> Set as template)

* Set the type to either filter by creation/join date
* Additionally you can filter out only the users that are not verified by setting the verified option to False

## Blacklisting channels

Prevent members from using bot commands in specific channels

## Auto-refresh leaderboard

Setup an invites lb that refreshes itself automatically. It also has a handy "check invites" button.

* Use the `/config auto-refresh-leaderboard set <channel>` slash command to set the channel where the lb is to be sent
* To disabled it, run the `/config auto-refresh-leaderboard reset` command
* Note: You can have only 1 auto-refresh lb per server

## Verification System

There are currently 3 types of verification:

* **Simple**: Members will have to press a button to get verified This type is effective against automated user accounts.
* **Password**: Set a pre-defined password which the user has to enter (using buttons) to get verified. Useful if you own a super exclusive server or you just want to hide the password in your rules, ensuring that all new members will actually read your server's rules :)
* **Randomised**: Make the bot randomise the password (of specified length) which the user has to enter (using buttons) to get verified.

Setting up the verification system:

Note:

* `role` is the role which will be given upon successful verification.
* `channel` is the channel where the verification embed will be sent.
* The embed can be customized by providing a json file in the `/config verification` command. This is restricted to premium tiers 2 and 3
